# Resting Metabolic Rate Projection Web App

## Overview
The RMR Projection Web App helps users calculate their Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) and project changes over time based on weight loss goals. This application uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equations for precise calculations and provides a user-friendly interface for data input and visualization.

## Technical Overview
The app leverages a streamlined DevOps pipeline to ensure seamless development, testing, and deployment processes Hereâ€™s an overview of the stack and CI/CD practices in place:

### Architecture
The application follows a **microservices architecture**
1. **Backend Microservie**
  - RESTful API for RMR calculations
  - Modular Python code with clear validation and error handling
2. **Frontend Microservie**
  - Single-page application
  - Interactive user interface for input and result visualization

### Tech Stack
- **Version Control**
  - **System**: GitHub
  - GitHub repository for each microservice and deplyment management
    - [Backend](https://github.com/yifattih/rmr-projection-api-model)
      - RESTful API 
      - Built with FastAPI
      - Provides endpoints for RMR calculations
    - [Frontend](https://github.com/yifattih/rmr-projection-client-browser)
      - Fully responsive and interactive single-page experience
      - Built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery
      - Static files served with Flask
    - [Deplyment Manager](https://github.com/yifattih/rmr-projection-iac)
        - Infrastructure as Code
        - Built with Terraform
- **Containerization**:
  - Docker is used to containerize the application
  - Docker Compose used in development environment to orchestrate the application services
  - Consistent environments across software lifecycle: development, testing, and deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - **GitHub Actions**: Automates the build, test, and delivery processes
  - **Linting and Static Analysis**: Integrated with **SonarCloud** for code quality and security analysis
  - **Test Coverage**: Coverage reports generated through **Codecov**, ensuring unit and integration tests cover critical functionality
  - **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration tests run on every push, pull request, and before deployment to catch issues early
- **Deployment**: 
  - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managed with Terraform
  - **Containerization**: Docker images hosted on GCP Artifact Registry
  - **Orchestration**: Serverless with GCP Cloud Run
  - **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions triggers builds, tests, reports, logging and deployments
  - **Deployment Strategy**: Automated and manual blue-green deployment strategy for zero-downtime
  - **Rollback Strategy**: Automated and manual instant reversion rollback on deployment failures
- **Observability**
  - **Monitoring and Alerting**: Prometheus for time series data. Grafana dashboards for visualization
  - **Logging**: Centralized logs via Google Cloud Logging

## Future Work
- Expanded Metrics: Track additional metrics like Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)
- Enhanced Visualization: Provide more detailed and interactive data visualizations
- Authentication, user accounts creation, and user data persistance for a more personalized experience
- Recommendations and prediction systems: Future implementation using [Neural Networks and other AI models](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024IEEEA..12o6050A/abstract)
